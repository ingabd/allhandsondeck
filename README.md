## Online collaborative tool:
1. Interactive whiteboard
2. VoIP
3. Transcriber

Created as a "scratch your own itch" project. Using socket.io as its core feature. This project demonstrate my ability in building web apps that solves problem, my own problem for now.

In my previous work, I felt overwhelmed with remote working conditions. Discussion through Zoom or Google Meet was very limited due to lag and other technical barriers, especially with older colleagues. High bandwidth communication is necessary if one want to convey complex information. May be if we can whiteboarding together we can discuss lot of things, both deep and broad, complex and creative things.

VoIP (voice over internet protocol) is one tool to solve lag problem in Zoom meeting. I think in engineering projects, integrity of the message is more important than seeing your colleagues talking. VoIP, because it only sends voice data, may be a lot less laggy than video streaming. Hopefully the message can be long and solid, and fully accepted by recipient, without "what" or "sorry there was lag can you say your statement again?".

Transcriber is necessary to detect lot of points in deep and creative discussion, sometimes you need hours of rephrasing from one hour of transcribed meeting. It will help in retaining important messages and revisit/reconstruct them in the future long after the meeting. Hopefully this will help because informations and ideas exchanged and cross-bred in meetings are knowledge base of a company, they can be considered "treasure". By save them in text, instead of videos, it can be easily referenced, and easier to handle.

Internet is such an amazing place. There are many tutorials including interactive whiteboard, so this project is more like "build app to solve a problem" and construct that solution from combining lot of tutorials.

Tech stacks:
Client: react, react native, paperjs, socket.io
Server: express, axios, socket.io
